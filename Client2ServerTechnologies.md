Need for 

 - Transport Protocol
 - Exchange of metadata

**WCF (SOAP), REST, gRPC**

History ...
How we exchange metadata ....

## Perspectives

 - Developer Productivity
	 - who's consuming the API's ? 
	 - are they on the same technology stack / platform ?
 - Platform / Technology Stack 
   - .NET
   - Java
   - Other
   - Browser / JavaScript
   - Mobile 
  - Code first vs. Metadata first 
 - Who's the client ?
   - Building an API for your own app ?
   - Building an API for 3th Party consumers ?
     - Custom
     - Generic
  - Connected or Request/Response ?
  - Sync vs Async ?
  - Server side starts conversation ...

*Do not always just use what Visual Studio supports out-of-the-box or implement further on the code generated by standard templates.*

## WCF

 SOAP stack
 .wsdl / XSD
 Visual Studio ... Add Service Reference ...
 Why not just share the Interface and use ClientBase<T>
